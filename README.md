## KLineKWP1281Lib_ESP32
**KLineKWP1281Lib_ESP32**  is a library designed for communicating with VAG control modules which use the proprietary VAG Key-Word 1281 protocol (KWP1281/KW1281), specifically through an ESP32 development board.

It is based on **[KLineKWP1281Lib](https://github.com/domnulvlad/KLineKWP1281Lib)**, with a few differences to make it more suitable for the FreeRTOS operating system.
The example sketches have been modified to illustrate these differences.

## Supported features:
- Everything supported by **KLineKWP1281Lib**
- Implied multi-instance support for managing multiple K-lines at the same time in a task-based environment (example included)
